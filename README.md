# 3D visualization GUI

Loads triangulated .obj meshes and displays them using OpenGl and Qt
also performs a segmetation algorithm on depth maps taken form a kinect sensor
and loads databases of 3D models and extracts dFPFH descriptors which then uses for
search and retrieval given a partial 3D model.

# Operations it performs:
1. Voxel grid filtering
2. Statistical outlier filtering
3. 3D model search and retrieval 
4. 3D image segmentation
